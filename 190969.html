	<p><strong>COLLECTION</strong></p>
	<p class="bio"> I am a 20 year old student from Bulgaria with ambitions in the Creative Bussines and Graphic Design.<br><br>

Currently I am studying  International Media and Entertainment Management in Breda University of Applied Sciences. 
I am a person who has always been interested both in the arts and social sciences. For me these are the things that are making the most impact of the human being.
 Since I was 8 years old I have been attracted by the world of arts and design. For me it was interesting and overwhelming to create something new, from the scratch or to recreate the art of some artists. However, as the world evolves, 
I was interested in taking my art one step further and integrate it with technology. My passion is Image Editing and Graphic Illustrations. Previus projects include Game Design, Web & Mobile Design, Poster Design, Book and Logo Design. For 5 years already I've been working with private clients and people looking to brighten their website, brochure, logo and etc. with better design. My ambitions can go really far and if I have something in mind, I don’t quit easy. I am curious about issues and solutions and I’m eager to learn new things I am open minded, and I always gain experience from everything. </p>
